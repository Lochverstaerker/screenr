## rofi options
# Usually you would set rofi options in ~/.Xresources
# If you haven't done that already, do it
# Check possible options using "rofi -dump-xresources"
# If you, however, want to override these global options for this script only,
# do it here:
# rofiopts="-bw 0 -hide-scrollbar -padding 14 -lines 7"
